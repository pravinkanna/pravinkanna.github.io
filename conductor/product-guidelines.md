# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Tech-Centric & Modern:** The design should reflect a "developer-first" aesthetic.
- **Aesthetic Elements:** Incorporate a dark mode theme, use monospace fonts for code snippets and headers, and utilize modern UI elements.
- **Focus:** Maintain a sleek, terminal-inspired or IDE-like look where appropriate, without sacrificing usability.

## Content & Voice
- **Casual & Approachable:** The writing style should be personal and conversational. This applies to the "About Me" section and technical blogs, aiming to build a human connection while still demonstrating technical competence.
- **Authentic:** Use a voice that reflects your personality, making the professional content feel more relatable.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Utility-First Tools:** For the `/tools` section, the focus is on speed and efficiency. The interface should be intuitive, with no unnecessary steps or complex navigation.
- **Responsive Design:** The portfolio must be fully functional and visually appealing across all device types, especially mobile and desktop.
